This Github repo contains the EFI folder required to install Mac OS Ventura 13.4 on your Thinkpad T440p. Please note that you will need to generate your own SMBIOS using
GenSMBIOS, and if you're using the stock trackpad instead of the T450/X1 Carbon 3rd Gen trackpad, I'm not sure if it will work. Last but not least, you will need to edit
the config.plist file with your MAC address. This step is crucial for working iMessage, so DON'T skip it!
