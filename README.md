This Github repo is for people who want to install MacOS Ventura on their Thinkpad T440p. I couldn't find anyone else who uploaded their EFI folder for Ventura to Github, so I think I may be the first one. Enjoy!
But first though, you'll have to use GenSMBIOS to generate an SMBIOS (by first selecting the config.plist file) for MacBookPro14,1 or 15,1, then use ProperTree to insert your MAC address at PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ROM (also by selecting the config.plist file)



Here's how to make it bootable:
1. Decompress Audio.zip
2. Create a folder called "Resources"
3. Move the Font, Audio, Image, and Label folders into the Resources folder.
4. Create a folder called "OC"
5. Move every folder except for the "Boot" folder into "OC"
6. Modify the info.plist file by following the intructions above.


The reason why I had to do this was because github wouldn't let me upload more than 100 files at a time, for those curious.
