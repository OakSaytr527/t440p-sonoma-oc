This Github repo is for people who want to install MacOS Ventura on their Thinkpad T440p. I couldn't find anyone else who uploaded their EFI folder for Ventura to Github, so I think I may be the first one. Enjoy!
But first though, you'll have to use GenSMBIOS to generate an SMBIOS for MacBookPro14,1 or 15,1, then use ProperTree to insert your MAC address at PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ROM.
